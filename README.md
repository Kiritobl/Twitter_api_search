# Twitter_api_search
use Twitter api to search tweets or users

!!You need to sign up for a development acount yourself,then you'll get a bear_token 

you are able to use my code to GET /2/users/:id/tweets , 3200 at most per user.

next_token is considered in  my code,so you can just run it on your PC
